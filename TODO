convert input to material UI
add a calendar icon if date is hidden but editable
remove headers of sections
create separators between sections
inside weekly, give each row a space
make the left margin smaller
make the X button smaller and bolder
maybe show x only when hovering?
for every section, make everything be in "columns" - date under date, text under text, etc..

try and come closer to design finalization
enter key after picking date/time from options adds entry
bring dragging to final usage (move inside sections, etc)
find better marking of no time shown
decide on final sections and implement them
STOP HERE AND CONSIDER WHATS NEXT
consider adding animations - for fun or practice
integrate offline usage (cookies?)
add saved (or online/offline) indication
find server to use
convert/maintain android app
consider switching to save API to be only new change
consider getting new IDs from the server? (or just max id, or something)
add undo for actions
replace all console.log errors to show them properly
add vocal insertion of new entries
clicking c opens calendar view (to see dates and stuff)
